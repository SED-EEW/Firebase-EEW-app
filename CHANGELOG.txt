V0.5.0
- Added TrueTime -> NTP client for Android. Calculate the date and time "now" impervious to manual changes to device clock time.
- Added a Foreground service to obtain the user's location in background (if user gives the permissions)
- Requesting permission for removing the app from the app optimization battery to avoid missing notifications
while the app is on battery save mode, or it is not used regularly, etc.
- Created a new layout to ask the client for Points of Interest (POI). The POIs are used to estimate the MM intensity value
in case that the device GPS is not enabled (very useful to save battery).
-Added new layouts for Welcome for the first time using the app and for requesting permissions. The layouts contain
text to describe and provide information and action buttons.
- Added the license text description.
- New layout for alerting purpose with the Drop, Cover and Hold on message. It is created once an EQ event could generate
an intensity value >= VI on either user's location or POIs (MM VI is Hardcoded and on test).
- Shorting the class files in package folders according to their functionality and usage.
